* Shell utility

This library that let's you generate shell scripts from SBCL. Here's how:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(shell-utility:write-shell-utility :sbcl
  (:name "/home/username/bin/hello") ;; name of script
  (:load-system :alexandria)
  (:eval (defun hello (names &key (intensity "1"))
           (format t "Hello ~{~A~^ and ~}" names)
           (dotimes (n (read-from-string intensity))
             (princ "!"))
           (terpri)))
  (:launch hello)) ;; Call hello with error handler and parsed argv.
#+END_SRC

Evaluating the above form (fill in your username) will generate a
shell script that can be run as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
hello --intensity 2 Homer Marge Bart Lisa Maggie
#+END_SRC

Other commands are available too, please see examples.lisp or study
the source and tests.
